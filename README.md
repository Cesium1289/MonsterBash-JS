# What is this application? #

## This application is a turn-based game in which the user can create different monsters and fight against other computer-controlled monsters. The user can upgrade their stats by winning battles and using the gold earned to buy upgrades using the in-game shop. ##

# Program goal #
## The goal is to learn more about Vanilla JS and front-end development without the use of a framework. The application will have a functional UI that isn't just a black box with white text. ##
