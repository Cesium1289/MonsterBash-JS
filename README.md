# What is this application? #

## This application is a turn-based game in which the user can create different monsters and fight against other computer-controlled monsters. The user can upgrade their stats by winning battles and using the gold earned to buy upgrades using the in-game shop. ##

# Progam goal #
## This is a remake of an existing application that was originally written in C++ to learn more about vanilla JS. The goal is to remake this game program and give it a UI that isn't a black background with white text. ##
